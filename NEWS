v0.12 (2022-06-07)
  * Retry failed log requests.  This should make certspotter resilient
    to rate limiting by logs.
  * Add -version flag.
  * Eliminate unnecessary dependency. certspotter now depends only on
    golang.org/x packages.
  * Switch to Go modules.

v0.11 (2021-08-17)
  * Add support for contacting logs via HTTP proxies;
    just set the appropriate environment variable as documented at
    https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ProxyFromEnvironment
  * Work around RFC 6962 ambiguity related to consistency proofs
    for empty trees.

v0.10 (2020-04-29)
  * Improve speed by processing logs in parallel
  * Add -start_at_end option to begin monitoring new logs at the end,
    which significantly speeds up Cert Spotter, at the cost of missing
    certificates that were added to a log before Cert Spotter starts
    monitoring it
  * (Behavior change) Scan logs in their entirety the first time Cert
    Spotter is run, unless -start_at_end specified (behavior change)
  * The log list is now retrieved from certspotter.org at startup instead
    of being embedded in the source. This will allow Cert Spotter to react
    more quickly to the frequent changes in logs.
  * (Behavior change) the -logs option now expects a JSON file in the v2
    log list format. See <https://www.certificate-transparency.org/known-logs>
    and <https://www.gstatic.com/ct/log_list/v2/log_list_schema.json>.
  * -logs now accepts an HTTPS URL in addition to a file path.
  * (Behavior change) the -underwater option has been removed. If you want
    its behavior, specify https://loglist.certspotter.org/underwater.json to
    the -logs option.

v0.9 (2018-04-19)
  * Add Cloudflare Nimbus logs
  * Remove Google Argon 2017 log
  * Remove WoSign and StartCom logs due to disqualification by Chromium
    and extended downtime

v0.8 (2017-12-08)
  * Add Symantec Sirius log
  * Add DigiCert 2 log

v0.7 (2017-11-13)
  * Add Google Argon logs
  * Fix bug that caused crash on 32 bit architectures

v0.6 (2017-10-19)
  * Add Comodo Mammoth and Comodo Sabre logs
  * Minor bug fixes and improvements

v0.5 (2017-05-18)
  * Remove PuChuangSiDa 1 log due to excessive downtime and presumptive
    disqualification from Chrome
  * Add Venafi Gen2 log
  * Improve monitoring robustness under certain pathological behavior
    by logs
  * Minor documentation improvements

v0.4 (2017-04-03)
  * Add PuChuangSiDa 1 log
  * Remove Venafi log due to fork and disqualification from Chrome

v0.3 (2017-02-20)
  * Revise -all_time flag (behavior change):
    - If -all_time is specified, scan the entirety of all logs, even
      existing logs
    - When a new log is added, scan it in its entirety even if -all_time
      is not specified
  * Add new logs:
    - Google Icarus
    - Google Skydiver
    - StartCom
    - WoSign
  * Overhaul log processing and auditing logic:
    - STHs are never deleted unless they can be verified
    - Multiple unverified STHs can be queued per log, laying groundwork
      for STH pollination support
    - New state directory layout; current state directories will be
      migrated, but migration will be removed in a future version
    - Persist condensed Merkle Tree state between runs, instead of
      reconstructing it from consistency proof every time
  * Use a lock file to prevent multiple instances of Cert Spotter from
    running concurrently (which could clobber the state directory).
  * Minor bug fixes and improvements

v0.2 (2016-08-25)
  * Suppress duplicate identifiers in output.
  * Fix "EOF" error when running under Go 1.7.
  * Fix bug where hook script could fail silently.
  * Fix compilation under Go 1.5.

v0.1 (2016-07-27)
  * Initial release.
